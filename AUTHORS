VikingUI was originall created in 2014 by Kevin Altman.
Maintainance was picked up by the community in October 2015, and the project
renamed VikingReborn.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS -- people
who have submitted patches, reported bugs and ideas, helped answer questions,
and generally made VikingUI a great project:

Christian "mkaito" HÃ¶ppner <chris@mkaito.com>
Kevin "itsthatguy" Altman <kevin@itsthatguy.com>
